Kafka clients sometimes have problems producing messages because of an incident or maintenance. 
In most cases these issues are short lived, but clients get paged and while long incidents are rare, they are memorable. 
In this talk, we'll run through our Kafka infrastructure at Shopify and how clients connect to it. 
Next, we'll describe our solution for performing failovers using DNS. Afterwards, we'll look at some real world scenarios where this system saved us from major outages. 
In conclusion, Kafka clusters are more resilient to infrastructure hiccups with a DNS traffic manager and opinionated client wrappers.
